### hell (placeholder title)

hopefully a (GBC only) game

### compiling

dependencies:
- [RGBDS](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds), v6.0.0 should work
- [SuperFamiconv](https://github.com/Optiroc/SuperFamiconv)
- GNU make (v4.3 should work) (todo: add link)

all of the above must be located in your PATH

to build:
1. run `make` in the repo root

build artifacts will go in `bin/`, `obj/`, and `src/`
