### compiling

dependencies:
- [RGBDS](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds), v6.0.0 should work
- [SuperFamiconv](https://github.com/Optiroc/SuperFamiconv)
- GNU make (v4.3 should work) (todo: add link)

all of the above must be located in your PATH

1. create folders `bin/`, `obj/` and `gfx/bin/`
2. run `make` in the repo root

build artifacts will go in `bin/`, `obj/`, and `src/res/`
